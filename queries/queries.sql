-- Project:
-- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Healthcare Dataset

-- Description:
-- This file contains analytical SQL queries designed
-- to evaluate and analyze:

--   - semantic chunk distribution
--   - AI response reliability
--   - retrieval effectiveness
--   - topic coverage
--   - confidence scoring
--   - semantic relevance ranking

-- Query Categories:
--   1. Aggregation Queries
--   2. Join Queries
--   3. Subqueries
--   4. CTE Queries
--   5. Window Function Queries
